## üìä Dataset Description

The dataset used in this project contains the following columns:

- `Date`: The date of data collection.
- `Region`: The state or region in focus.
- `Estimated Unemployment Rate (%)`: Unemployment rate in the given region.
- `Estimated Employed`: Number of employed individuals.
- `Estimated Labour Participation Rate (%)`: Participation rate in the workforce.
- `Longitude` and `Latitude`: Coordinates for geographical mapping.

The dataset is cleaned and preprocessed to ensure quality analysis.

## üîç Algorithms

### Random Forest Classifier
The Random Forest Classifier is used for predicting unemployment rates based on historical data. This ensemble learning method provides high accuracy and handles missing data effectively.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Workflow

1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**:
   - Clean the dataset by removing null values and standardizing column names.
   - Convert dates to a suitable format for time-series analysis.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**:
   - Visualize unemployment trends using line charts, histograms, and heatmaps.
   - Analyze geographical impacts using interactive maps.

3. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Extract key features like month, year, and region.

4. **Model Training**:
   - Train the Random Forest Classifier on a portion of the dataset.
   - Evaluate model accuracy and performance.

5. **Prediction and Insights**:
   - Use the model to predict unemployment rates.
   - Display predictions and insights in the Streamlit app.
